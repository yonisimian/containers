# Containers
In this repository, you will find generic containers written in c / c++.
This repository is made for educational purposes, therefore I have tried to provide diversity of implementations, among them you will find:
- Containers based on arrays (easy implementation, limited size)
- Containers based on nodes (a little complicated, unlimited size)
- Containers with iterators
- And much more...

_So... what's on the menu?!_
|C              |C++                       |
|---------------|--------------------------|
|Ordered Map    |Sorted List (Node-Based)  |
|List    		     |List (Node-Based)         |
|Queue			       |Queue (List-Based)		      |
|Stack    		    |Stack (Array-Based)       |
|Set			         |Set (Array-Based)		       |


## C containers

All of the containers written in C are implemented using nodes, because I think the array-based containers are boring and non educational.
There are currently 5 containers:
- **Ordered Map** - the most detailed and complicated one.
It contains an unlimited amount of key-data pairs, and is sorted by the key.
Both the key and the data can be anything (void*), as long as you copy & free them.
The map also provides an **iterator** and a macro to iterate over the container.
- **Linked List** - good old fashioned lover linked-list. 
Also provides an iterator, but is overall less detailed than the previous container.
However, the list also contains **apply** and **filter** functions which are very useful!
- **Queue** - just a simple queue, no iterator or interesting functions.
- **Stack** - same as above.
- **Set** - also provides an iterator, a macro, and two pleasant functions - **union** and **intersection**.

>NOTE:  All of the C containers use **function pointers** in order to maintain it's generalness, because all of it's data is void* and must be copied, freed and compared using functions given by the user.

>NOTE:  All of the errors in these containers are handled using enums of the possible results.
 
## C++ Containers

These containers are implemented using various ways, because I think it's more interesting.
There are currently 5 containers:
- **Sorted List** - the most detailed and complicated one.
It is basically just a sorted linked list, but is very detailed and also the only container I have written to provide a **const-iterator** instead of a regular one. 
It also provides **apply** and **filter** functions, that are good examples of using templates.
- **Linked List** - similar to the previous one, but much simpler and unsorted.
- **Queue** - the only container I have written using std as it's base (instead of nodes or array).
It's a good example (in my opinion) for using std for our purposes.
- **Stack** - the first container to be implemented using an array.
It's very basic, so it's a good example for implementing C containers using arrays.
- **Set** - a normal set with all it's find / expand / unite / intersect shenanigans.

>NOTE:  All of the C containers use **templates** in order to maintain it's generalness.
The usage of templates forces us to assume characteristics about the data stored in the container (more details in the Sorted List documentation).

>NOTE:  All of the errors in these containers are handled using exceptions (some inherit std::exception, some not).

## Summary
All of the above containers are made by me for educational purposes.

I do not explain what a container is or how does it work, you can find plenty of these explanations in the internet.
I do provide the implementation and some documentation for the containers, becuase finding them in the internet is a bit harder.

You can copy and use it for your purposes, learn from it and even upgrade it.
The downside is that it might have bugs, because I'm not a master programmer, yet ;)
